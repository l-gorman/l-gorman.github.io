My background is in Physics and International Development. Today I use some really useful tools (such as R, Python etc...). I am not in the best position to explain how to use these things, but over time I have found some resources that really helped me. Here are some of the most helpful. 

## Great overall introductions:

As a starter for python, git, applied data analysis I highly recommend [these courses](https://milliams.com/courses/#courses) developed by a team at the [University of Bristol Advanced Computing Research Centre](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/acrc-training/). There are also some [video versions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv3dZ12v9kI4ZO1cAQouJvA) of these courses. I also attended a [course in research software engineering](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rsd-engineeringcourse/) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/rsd-engineeringcourse)). These courses are a fantastic start!

## Useful Statistics/Machine Learning Books:

### Multi-Level Modelling: 

* [General statistics and multi-level modelling](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/learning/online-course/): The Bristol Centre for multi-level modelling provides a really excellent course on multi-level modelling. It was designed for social scientists, so the explanations are really clear and intuitive. The course focused on multi-level modelling, however, the first few chapters provide a really useful foundation for more straightforward regression. 

### Bayesian


* [Bayesian Analysis](https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/DBDA_recoded/): Kruschke originally wrote this book as an introduction to bayesian analysis in R, JAGS, Stan. This link provides a translation of the book into brms, a package which simplifies bayesian analysis by using similar syntax to R's base regression packages.

* [More Bayesian analysis](https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/Statistical_Rethinking_recoded/): Another good introduction to bayesian analysis is McElreath's "Statistical Rethinking". This link provides another translation into the brms package.

* [Bayesian analysis in python and R](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-bayesian-approach-to-linear-mixed-models-lmm-in-r-python-b2f1378c3ac8)

### General Machine Learning

When I first started my PhD, I had heard 'Machine Learning' thrown around as a term. I didn't really know what techniques were included and what it meant. [This book](http://themlbook.com/) provided a nice overview of some of the key topics. Bishops [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf) provides a much more in depth explanation of some key techniques. I would use this when you want to dig a little deeper into some things.

####  R

[An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-7138-7): When I first started working in R, this book was recommended to me. It was only a few years later that I started to dig into it. I would highly recommend it as a nice overview of some machin learning techniques.


## Python 

As mentioned above. I highly recommend [these courses](https://milliams.com/courses/#courses) developed by a team at the [University of Bristol Advanced Computing Research Centre](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/acrc-training/)
